# jenkins-ci-template
This repo is intended to make it easy to setup Jenkins to build and deploy a Windows Service. 

This Windows Service is depending on NuGet packages and custom build, deploy and install scripts. 

##Credits:
I did not create or author the Windows Service install sciprts and therefore I would like to point you to the original author:
